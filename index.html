    <h2>A Special Letter from Me to You...</h2>
    <p>MY Dear Chinni Talli,</p>
    <p>
      I can’t express how lucky I am to have you in my life. From the moments we've shared, the laughs, the love, and all the adventures, my life has been nothing short of magical.

    On this special day, I wanted to take a moment to wish you the happiest and most magical birthday ever Ma! You are truly one of the sweetest souls l'ue ever had the pleasure of knowing, and your presence in my life has been an absolute blessing. Your kindness, warmth, and positivity light up the world around you. You have a heart of gold, and your smile has the power to brighten even the darkest of days. Today hope all the love and joy you've given to others come back to you in abundance. May your day be filled with laughter, surrounded by friends and family who adore you just as much as I do. May your dreams take flight and your aspirations be realized. This year, I wish for you a world of beautiful moments, adventures, and endless happiness. Thank you for being the wonderful person you are. Happy Birthday, Here's to celebrating you and all the incredible moments that lie ahead. Thanks for being part of my life...

Koncham Navvandi Madam....!

    Oye, 2025 is coming in 4 month's. Thank you for bringing me happiness All the Time, I'm not asking for much in 2025 I wish we still share our heart's together, love each other, Annoy each other, laugh together, over come hard time's together. Anta kadu anukunna,I'm yours and you are mine.. LOVE YOU Kiddo ALWAYS....!


    Just because we don't talk anymore doesn't mean I've forgotten about you, it doesn't mean that I no longer care, truth is I still DO, I do my best to check up on you, to See How you're Doing, to See if you're okay, but everytime I get the urge to talk to you, it suddenly hits me that we are STRANGERS, hence the reason I'm no longer a part of you; But even though everything's changed;I just want you to know that, I'm still here, I'll still be here for you, I'll still lend you my shoulders. Idc, what time it is or what I am Doing, don't hesitate to talk to me, bz half of the time, I wish you were talking to me. I miss your presence, I miss you being my bestfriend. I JUST MISS YOU!
